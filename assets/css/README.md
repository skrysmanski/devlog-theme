# SASS Style Sheets

This folder contains SASS (SCSS) style sheets.

Documentation: <https://sass-lang.com/documentation/>

*Note on partials:* As a convention, Sass files that are only meant to be imported, not compiled on their own, begin with `_` (as in `_code.scss`). These are called partials, and they tell Sass tools not to try to compile those files on their own. You can leave off the `_` when importing a partial.
