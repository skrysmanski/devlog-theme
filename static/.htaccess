# Caching
#
# See: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control
#

# Set "no-cache" for all files by default. This way, the browser will never display outdated files.
#
# NOTE: "no-cache" just means: Ask the server if there are any changes before serving the file from cache (unlike "no-store").
#   So there's still a file cache involved. The browser does this by sending a request with the If-Modified-Since header.
#   If the webserver returns HTTP 304 (file not modified), the browser uses the cached version.
Header set Cache-Control: "no-cache"
