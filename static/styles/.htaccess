<Files "*.css">
    # Since the files in this directory are fingerprinted (i.e. their name changes if their content changes),
    # we can basically cache them indefinitely. Thus, we set the max-age to 1 year and add "immutable".
    #
    # See: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control
    #
    # NOTES:
    # * According to https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Expires, the Expires header is ignored
    #   if max-age is used. Thus, we don't need to set it.
    # * We don't use mod_expires here as we don't need an Expires header and since mod_expires is very limited in what
    #   you can specify for the "Cache-Control" header (i.e. no "immutable", no "no-cache").
    # * At the time of writing, "immutable" is only supported by Firefox and Safari. Chrome and Edge do not support it
    #   (see: https://caniuse.com/mdn-http_headers_cache-control_immutable). However, adding it doesn't break anything
    #   for browsers that don't support it - so it can be safely added.
    Header set Cache-Control: "max-age=31536000, immutable"
