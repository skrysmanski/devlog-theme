# Theme for manski.net

**Archived:** This repository has been integrated into <https://github.com/skrysmanski/devlog> and thus is now archived.

This is the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) theme for my website <https://manski.net>.

It's used through: <https://github.com/skrysmanski/devlog>

While this theme is open source it's not meant to be used anywhere else. Meaning, I won't be fixing bugs or adding features that don't apply to my site :)
