  This partial is included at the very top of "baseof.html". It makes sure that our custom ".Paginator" object
  is properly defined and available from the very start of the page (e.g. even in the <head> element).

  The primary reason for this is to provide proper permalinks for pagination pages. At the moment, ".Permalink"
  always points to page 1 - even for other pages: https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/4507 . With this we
  make sure the proper ".Paginator" is available in "permalink-abs.html" and this correct permalinks can be generated.

  This partial also makes sure the ".Paginator" object is initialized the way we want it (sorting, items per page).
  Reason: You can only have one(!) paginator per page. Subsequent calls to ".Paginate" will simply return the main/single
  paginator (and ignore all of its options). Through this partial we make sure that our call to ".Paginate" is the very
  first and thus properly defines the paginator for this page. (See also: https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/determine-if-current-page-is-result-of-pagination/37494/4)
