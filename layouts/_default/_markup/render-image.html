  Unfortunately, we can't use <figure> here as this creates invalid HTML - basically because
  the image render hook can't/must not create block elements like <figure>. Thus, we must
  ONLY USE INLINE ELEMENTS!
  See: https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/6748

  SIDE NOTE: Images may sometimes be used inline - so it would actually be bad to return
    a block element in this case.

  NOTE: This code doesn't differentiate between inline and block images (there doesn't seem to
    be a way). So, this differentiation is done in JavaScript.

    By default, .Destination is simply the image name. And since we strip the trailing slash from
    URLs, browser will use the wrong URL when fetching images (i.e. "../parent-folder/image.png" instead
    of "../parent-folder/my-article/image.png"). So we make the url "absolute" here.
