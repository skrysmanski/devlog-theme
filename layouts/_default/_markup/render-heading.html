<!-- IMPORTANT: Use "&nbsp;" before the anchor/permalink hash so that it never stands alone on the next line. -->
<!-- NOTE: We don't add a tooltip to the permalink # because this may cause a horizontal scrollbar on small screens if the # is too close to the right
       edge of the screen. Similarly, if the # is too close to the left edge of the screen (because the heading was longer than one line), the tooltip
       will get truncated on the left side (though at least no scrollbar will appear). Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a solution for this
       problem, so we disable the tooltips altogether. (Users will figure out what the # does.)
